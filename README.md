How to Implement a Custom Rate My App Control


This is a tutorial on how to implement a Rate My App usercontrol (C#/XAML) over which the developer has a hand on how the rate my app control works

As you can see in the code everything is located in the share folder in Visual Studio.

Today, this control is working the following way:

- the Rate My App Control can be shown when the applciation is launch
- the Rate My App Control can allow you to ask for users to send you feedback and the rate your app
- You have commented code that shows you where you can add feature like show the control once the user has launched the app 5 times


This code is to be used as is, i cannot garanty that this code will work everywhere, however this is the code that i use in my personal apps: http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Delaire%2BDamien

I will try to add more tutorial on how i use different components in Windows Phone, Windows Store and Universal Windows Apps
